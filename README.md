What functionality is working so far?
 -findName, delete, insert, size, printAllContacts, searchAllContacts, and everything in Contact.java
What problems/bugs are you currently running into (if any)?
 -when doing the JUnit testing for findNumber, I keep getting a fail on the assertNotNull line
Provide a planned schedule for when you aim to complete each remaining aspect of the project
 -once I get help on the one error I'm getting, I'll be done and ready to turn in.
